## General info
A resource pack that expands Antique Atlas 4 with markers for a wide range of modded structures. Existing packs rarely cover more than a handful of mods, so this project aims to provide broad support in one place.

The pack is in early development. Most supported structures are already mapped, though a placeholder Bastion marker is still used. Custom marker sets for each structure category are planned for future releases.

Designed for Forge 1.20.1 with the Fabric-ported version of Antique Atlas 4. Compatibility with other versions is not guaranteed.
